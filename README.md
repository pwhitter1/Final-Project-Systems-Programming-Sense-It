# Final-Project-Systems-Programming-Sense-It
We created this game, which tests memory, speed, and dexterity using this code, various sensors, and an Arduino Uno.
To play the game, you need to upload the FinalProject, Combined_Color_Accel, and Caitlin_to_Nathalie_Arduinos sketches on three separate computers (as well as set up the external sensors with the Arduinos properly).
